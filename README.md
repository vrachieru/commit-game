# The committer guessing game!

## About the game

In the commit game, you have to guess the author of a commit based on its commit message.

The goal is to get the longest streak! (It's harder than you think...)

## How do I play?

- Clone the repo and do a clean install. Or download the [executable](../maven-repository/raw/master/releases/com/vrachieru/commit-game/1.0/commit-game-1.0.jar).
- Fire up a terminal (Linux/OSX) or cmd (Windows)
- Navigate to the path of a git repository
- Execute the jar by typing: `java -jar /path/to/commit-game-[version].jar`

## Requirements

- Java >= 1.7
